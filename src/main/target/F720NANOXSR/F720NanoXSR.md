The F720NanoXsr is my custom 20x20 F7 based flight controller.
It has solder pads on the backside to solder on a TBS nano and a FRsky r-xsr
and JST plugs for ESC with telemetry, Camera with selectable camera control or a full uart and a LED strip

The 27MHz clock for the OSD is generated by the PLL of the F7 to save an additional resonator.
I'm not sure if I got the default settings right, so you might have to experiment a bit if you're building a quad with it.
