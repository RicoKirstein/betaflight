The F7162 is my custom 16x16(21x21outline) F7 based flight controller.
The notches on the corners allow it to also be mounted in a 20x20 pattern.
It has 3 full UARTS and one TX only UART on solder pads.
also: LEDstrip output, camera control output with resistor and cap onboard,
input for current sensing
and the AT7456 OSD 
The 27MHz clock for the OSD is generated by the PLL of the F7 to save an additional resonator.
I'm not sure if I got the default settings right, so you might have to experiment a bit if you're building a quad with it.
You can get the eagle files for it from my dropbox at

I also uploaded the boards to OSHpark and AISLER for odering.
